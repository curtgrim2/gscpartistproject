"LA VIDA ES UN CARNIVAL" - Listed among Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest 
  Songs of All Time and Tropical Song of the Year  for the Lo Nuestro Awards, this song is 
  among Cruz’s most popular and influential. In this song, Cruz talks about how you should 
  sing through life's struggles and hardships instead of crying as it's all just a carnival.

“QUIMBARA” - This song is one of the most celebrated in Cruz's career and is said to have a huge impact on 
  the salsa genre. She sang this song in a duet with Johnny Pacheco. Notably, the song title is also its

  song, which is one that is seen as an anthem for the LGBT community, implies a lot on 
  her stance on  the matter. But unlike the original version, it is sung in Spanish.
